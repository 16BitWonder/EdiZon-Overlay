# How To Use Submenus

In your cheat text document you can add submenus by using these 2 tags

    [--SectionStart:<Section Name>--]
    [--SectionEnd:<Section Name>--]

Example:

    [--SectionStart:Item Codes--]
    00000000 00000000 00000000    

    [Items x999]
    040A0000 01DB2A08 52807CE0

    [--SectionEnd:Item Codes--]
    00000000 00000000 00000000

This will create a submenu called ***Item Codes*** with ***Items x999*** being a cheat in that submenu.

Warning: Having too many cheats at once can lead to stability issues and can crash.
